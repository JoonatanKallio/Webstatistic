Statistics webpage
===============
This is a school project where I decided to create a statistics webpage. The user can see all the employment statistics and population statistics by municipal or from the whole country. There are also multiple different years the user can choose from. The data is then illustrated by coloring the municipalities in an informative way. This page utilizes StatFinn public API.
